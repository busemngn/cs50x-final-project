    <h4>Picture</h4><br>
    <p>Adding a picture to your CV can be a cultural and industry-specific choice. In some countries and professions, including a professional headshot is common, while in others, it's not typically expected. Here are some considerations:</p>
    <h5>When to Include a Picture:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cultural Norms:</strong> In some countries, like many European ones, it's customary to include a professional photo on your CV. It's seen as a way to make the CV more personal.</li>
        <li><strong>Client-Facing Roles:</strong> If you're applying for roles where appearance is relevant, such as modeling, acting, or customer service, a photo might be beneficial.</li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <h5>When to Avoid Including a Picture:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Anti-Discrimination:</strong> In many places, CVs are evaluated based on skills, qualifications, and experiences. Including a photo can introduce the potential for unconscious bias or discrimination.</li>
        <li><strong>Professionalism:</strong> For most jobs that aren't client-facing or in the entertainment industry, your skills, experiences, and achievements are more relevant than your appearance.</li>
    </ol>

                <li><strong>Professional Quality:</strong> If you decide to include a picture, ensure it's a high-quality, professional headshot. The background should be neutral, and you should be well-groomed and dressed appropriately.</li>
                <li><strong>Positioning:</strong> Place the photo at the top of your CV, usually in the header. Ensure it doesn't take up too much space and doesn't distract from the rest of your content.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> If you include a picture, use the same photo on your other professional profiles like LinkedIn.</li>
            </ol>

          <p class="card-text">Before deciding to include a photo on your CV, research the norms in your industry and region. If you're uncertain, it might be a good idea to err on the side of caution and exclude the photo to ensure that your application is evaluated purely on your qualifications and skills.</p>
